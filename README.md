## Benefits of Virtualization of Server Infrastructure 
### Objective
To gain experience preparing an executive summary and to research how virtualization may benefit an organization in terms of their server infrastructure.

### Description
Roleplay that you are a system administrator for an organization that is attempting to determine if virtualization of its server infrastructure would be beneficial to the organization. Examine the basic benefits and problems that are related to server virtualization.

## Executive Summary
Why choose server virtualization for your server infrastructure? This report will guide you through basic benefits and problems that are related to server virtualization. One of the most important question to ask yourself is, “Is server virtualization beneficial to my organization?”. If you are considering this route, it is because your organization could potentially save resources and spent them elsewhere where it really counts. The following points will explain the basics, benefits, and disadvantages of server virtualization.
    
### Server Consolidation
The organization may rely heavy on multiple physical servers that may accommodate several applications to run simultaneously. According to Techopedia, physical servers usually only utilized between 15-30 percent of the overall server’s capacity. But with server consolidation, the organization will be able to utilize well-over 80 percent of a server’s capacity and reduce the number of multiple physical servers.  Server consolidation will aid in reducing capital spent on physical servers and at the same time reduce any operational expenses relating with multiple servers. 

### Potential Benefits
According to Business World, three main benefits to server virtualization are:
    1.	Cost reduction: Save on hardware purchases/upgrades, operational management, energy, and real estate expenses.
    2.	Automation: Reduce number of technicians and/or reduce pressure off the IT department.
    3.	Backup / Recovery: Reliable backups and the restoring of data that may result in cyberattacks or natural disasters.
    
### Potential Drawbacks
    1.	Upfront Costs: Savings will outweigh the expenditures, but it is specific to each organization. It only considers long term savings when it balances out costs at the end. Another cost factor is including software licensing. Licensing costs have been decreasing due to competition, but it may still be costly.
    2.	Security Risk: Server virtualization carries an additional data security risk. To ensure data integrity and safety, check if the provider is PCI complaint or how they handle security.

### Recommendation
Given the above points, I recommend transitioning to server virtualization because the benefits far outweigh the drawbacks. It benefits the organization in many different levels of cost expenses, it promotes automation to ease the workload of everyday tasks, and it implements a reliable backup and restore system
